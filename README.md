Hi! Welcome to my GitHUB profile.

My name is Samuel Stuckey, but I go by Sam.

I am currently a CS Sophomore at UIC who spends most of their time playing rouge-lites or reading math books, and as of late I have developed a interest with the feilds of systems and cybersecurity based on my recent classes in the subject matter.

Feel free to check out my projectsâ€”I'm always open to feedback and new ideas! Let's connect and build something amazing!

Please reach out to me if you have any questions:
