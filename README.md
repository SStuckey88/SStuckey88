Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile üëã
I'm Samuel Stuckey, but you can call me Sam!

I'm a CS sophomore at UIC with a budding interest for systems and cybersecurity. Lately, I've been jumping into these fields through coursework, studying for certificates like the ComptiaA+ exam,  and competitions like the Department of Energy's CyberForce 2024.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing roguelikes, listening to Japanese Jazz, reading random math/Computer Science articles, or experimenting with new tech. I'm always on the lookout for CTFs, hackathons, and working on a project from my massive list of projects that I hope to have the time to complete one day.

Currently, I assist as my ACM local chapter's Communications head--scheduling and leading workshops and the like, I work part time at walmart as a sales representative, I do some gig work with my Barbershop chorus but its more of a hobby, and I will be an intern for Southern Company This Summer!

Feel free to check out my projects‚ÄîI'm always open to criticism, positive feedback, and ideas! Let's connect and build something amazing.
